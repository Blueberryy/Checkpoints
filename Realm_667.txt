[UPDATE] Checkpoint Disk

[UPDATE] Changes:

+ Realm 667 Typos Fixed
+ Preview picture now properly maintains aspect ratio
+ Fixed 2 Fountain Spawners appearing when 2 Disks are touched at the same time.
+ Checkpoints no longer crashes Zandronum at all.
+ Fixed Z-Cancelling still partially working when disabled
+ Fixed sp_checkpoint_warp applying to the world when a player disconnects
+ Fixed "Waiting to Warp..." being off centered with CVAR sp_ZCancel disabled
+ Fixed Inventory.PickupMessage not pointing to it's respective Language string
+ Save Disk Now occupies 32035 as it's Reserved TID and Ednum

Mostly fixes. Like that mispelled survival in Checkpoint Disk's description. It's been driving me nuts.
