## **Overview**
Checkpoints!<br />
They autosave in singleplayer, sets the spawn in multiplayer and resurrects everyone in surival!<br />
It's more or less an alternative to that pesky unexpected scripted autosave, forcing an access to the HDD while buffering the game for half a second or more, even possibly saving while in a bad situation! This system hopes to give the player choice! <br />

It also solves the "running to evil" problem present in co-op. By updating the spawn position to it when it's touched. Players can get right back into the action with little to no delay.

## **Features**
* Zandronum and GZDoom Compatible! (Not ZDoom though)
* Different functionality depending on gamemode
* Uses an actor for it's position tracking so that it could be placed on moving sectors without any clips.
* Still Saves in GZDoom Multiplayer.
* Collision-Safe! It's unable to telefrag existing Players.
* Sprite Bridge Safe! (If you can find one...)
* Fail-Safe! Holding zoom cancels you out of it's effects if the destination is undesirable
* Warp-Safe! Still gives you respawn protection.
* Mod-Safe! Designed to run with *anything*!
* Comes with options for customizing.
* Mapper Friendly! You only need to place the checkpoint object on the map to use the system.
* Presets!

## **Presets**<br />
The checkpoint system was only really meant as a resource for mappers, but the people I've shown this to expressed of adding sometype of way to place this into pre-existing maps. So I made this! Currently the only mapset supported is [AUGER;ZENITH](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/123042-dbp37-augerzenith-the-cyberpunk-megawad/) but I plan to add more mapsets in the future and you can too, since project's open-source.
