Checkpoints!<br />
They Autosave in singleplayer, sets the spawnpoint in multiplayer and revives everyone in surival.<br />
It's an alternative to that pesky unexpected autosave, forcing an access to the HDD while buffering the game for half a second or more, even possibly saving while in a bad situation! This system hopes to give the player choice!

**Features**
* Zandronum and GZDoom Compatible! (Not ZDoom though)
* Diffrent functionality depending on gamemode
* Uses an actor for it's position tracking so that it could be placed on moving sectors without any clips.
* Collision-Safe! It's unable to telefrag existing Players.
* Sprite Bridge Safe! (If you can find one...)
* Fail-Safe! Holding zoom cancels you out of it's effects if the destination is undesirable
* Warp-Safe! Still gives you respawn protection.
* Presets!

**Preset System.**<br />
The checkpoint system was only really meant as a resource for mappers, but the people I've shown this to expressed of adding sometype of way to place this into pre-existing maps. So I made this! Currently the only mapset supported is [AUGER;ZENITH](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/123042-dbp37-augerzenith-the-cyberpunk-megawad/) but I plan to add more mapsets in the future and you can too, as the projects open-source.
